Hi! I'm currently as a student who goes by the full name is Le Nhut Nam (with Vietnamese format). I lived in Vietnam since I was born, for studying I'm now living in Ho Chi Minh City, for three years.

My background is Computer Science at Ho Chi Minh University of Science, VNU (HCMUS), before go to there for my learning, I used to live in home town - Tayninh, for a long time in my childhood.
