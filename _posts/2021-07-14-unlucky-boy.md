You know who I am? Of course, you don't know who I am and so am I. Do you know about 99% difficulties we face in our life is cause by ourself?

I'm a failure, a man who failed to create his own plan for his future? What I've done? What I'm doing during my time at my university? Learn? Coding? Fuck that shit man, I try to learn a lot, try to watch Youtube, try to implement any algorithms, any exercises in my subjects and I have forgetten something important for me, English certification, friends, teamwork, ... my love. I lost everything, I can't hold any chances for me, lost scholarship

Is this an end for me? Working hard, try so hard in other to got so far away...away. The surrounding people, no one understands for me, no one can help me, and the most important question is how do I can stand again for all thing happen to me, COVID-19 make me sick, fuck this virus, it destroys everything in my plan, for sutdy, for the English Exam, for everything, .... It's depressed ....

I hope COVID-19 to be end as soon as possible, I want to solve my problem, make my life continue again, fix the bugs in my life.
